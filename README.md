# CableUI-React

_./server_ hosts the temporary server.
_./client_ hosts all relevant client side data.


_@observer components will track all @observable they use and re-render
if any of them changes._

_The main responsibility of stores is to move logic and state
out of your components into a standalone testable unit that can
be used in both frontend and backend JavaScript._
